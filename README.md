## Evolution

May 18th:
  - Started working on the website by gathering different ideas and models of how it could look like around the game.
  - After an idea by Romain, we searched, tested and successively coded the header of the website, using JavaScript for the first time.
  - Created footer of the website.
  - Started working on the page of the game itself, and how to make the game playable with PHP and/or JS. 
  - Encountered many problems while trying to make the grid of the game clickable.

May 19th:
  - Focused on resolving the problem with the game's grid, which disappeared by using JavaScript.
  - Put a test game on that page to give an idea of the game.
  - Worked on the aesthetic of the grid, particularly the borders and legends.
  - Worked on the Home page and the Game page, following the models conceived the day before.
  - Worked on the aesthetic of the website, following the theme and colors of the game Animal Crossing.

May 20th:
  - Created the Tutorial page of the website, giving tips and a global idea of how a nonogram works to the reader.
  - Reworked the header, footer, Home page and Game page with a few corrections.
  - Added buttons to travel between pages: one Home button in the header, two buttons in the Home page to the Tutorial and the Game page, and two buttons on the Tutorial page to Home and the Game page.
  - Started working on the Settings page, encountering problems of visibility with the elements and images on it.

May 21st:
  - Finished working on the settings page of the website, which appears when going to the Game page.
  - Created options on that same page, useless as of right now and waiting for the program to be fully active to be functional.

May 24th:
  - Put the website through a system of pages and htaccess, which makes easier to find websites pages and offers the possibility of to create a "404 Page Not Found" error page.

May 25th:
  - Reworked buttons of the website.
  - Created an error page, following the aesthetic of the website.
  - Added an automatic chronometer on the Game page, which will be the score of the player at the end of the game.
  - Started working on the communication between the website and the program, by looking up how to use a program coded in C# in a website with JavaScript, and how to use a text file alongside.

May 26th:
  - Added buttons on the Game page to change the background image of the website. The players has now three options: "Day Theme" which is default, "Night Theme", and "Beach Theme"
  - Started the creation of a database to communicate and save information between the website and the program, such as the scoreboard and the generated games.
